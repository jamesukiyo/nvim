## Neovim Config

Everything is conditionally loaded so startup is 30-40ms.

There are a load of plugins but quite a few are disabled or I switch them
around occasionally.

I probably won't update this often because I use a private chezmoi repo for
dotfiles.

I mainly write Rust, Svelte, Go and Typescript so it's centered around those.

Plenty of scuffed workarounds everywhere lol..
